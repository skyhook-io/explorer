2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and ensure they pass
5. Commit your changes (see commit message guidelines below)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Node.js 20+

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or remote)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/radar.git
cd radar

# Install frontend dependencies
cd web
npm install
cd ..

# Run in development mode
# Terminal 1: Backend
go run ./cmd/explorer --dev --no-browser

# Terminal 2: Frontend with hot reload
cd web
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

# Backend tests
go test ./...

# Frontend type check
cd web
npm run tsc

## Coding Standards

### Go

- Follow standard Go conventions and `gofmt`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle errors explicitly (no silent failures)

### TypeScript/React

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful component and prop names

### Commits

We follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(topology): add support for StatefulSets`
- `fix(sse): handle reconnection on network errors`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one approval
2. CI checks must pass (tests, build)
3. Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR
4. Respond to review feedback promptly

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for bugs or feature discussions
- Check existing issues and PRs for context
